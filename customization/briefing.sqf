NEWTAB("A. Enemy Forces:")
1.b.) Enemy Forces overview. The 101st MIBN is counter-attacking in order to re-secure key pieces of terrain. 
<br/>
<br/>1.b.1.) Composition, Disposition and Strength.  Recent intelligence suggests the enemy is preparing for a counter-attack. The enemy is believed to be a company minus in strength. They has access to BMP-3s, GAZ Tigers, 2 x 60mm mortar, and possibly a T-90 section (see Annex 2).
<br/>
<br/>
1.b.2.) Most Probable Course of Action. The enemy will engage friendly M2A2s with direct fire from their armor assets. Once our M2A2s are destroyed, the enemy will achieve fire superiority and close with and destroy our forces in close quarters battle.
<br/>
<br/>
1.b.3.) Most Dangerous Course of Action. No change to above except enemy will use 60mm indirect fire to suppress our forces as they commit the BMP-3 to the attack.
<br/>
<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:<br/>
<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:
OBSERVATION.  Enemy will likely have eyes on the northern side of BP Pistol south of Telos or along the ridge vicinity TRP 1-3.<br/>
<br/>
INDIRECT.  1 The MIC has 1 x 60mm mortar section (2k range) providing indirect fire support to the their forward elements.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECT.  The PLT will have BMP-3 that will have thermals and will be able to engage friendly forces out to (3km). Individual small arms will consist of AK-47, PKM, RPG-7.<br/>
<br/>

1.c.1.) 1.c.1.) BN Mission.  1300 1-18 IN defends OBJ Pistol in order to hold the town of Charkia and enable freedom of maneuver to follow-on Brigade forces..<br/>
<br/>
1.c.2.) 1.c.2.) Concept of Main Effort Mission. 1-18 has seized OBJ Pistol. However, enemy forces are preparing a counter-attack. A/1-18 is tasked to defend BP Pistol orienting fires to the north west while D/1-18 provides direct fire coverage to the North, North-East.
<br/>
<br/>
1.c.3.) Adjacent Units. Battalion Mortars are currently located at mortar firing position (MFP) 1 and under the control of Attack 6. D/1-18 IN is located at SBF Dog.

NEWTAB("C. General Notes:")
General Notes:<br/>
<br/>
General Notes:
 - Dog Company’s presence is notional. However, there will be barriers to prevent the enemy forces from entering areas that D/1-18 could potentially engage them.<br/>
<br/>
- The Company Commander can preposition obstacles and defensive positions. See Annex 6 for complete list of available material.<br/>
<br/>
- There will be a 5 minute setup timer for both sides. Neither side will be able to move more than 10m outside this setup zone.
<br/>
- The company sergeant humvee contains a Javelin system intended to be used by either white squad.

1.a.) Civilian Overview. There should be zero civilian presence on the battlefield.
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("A. Enemy Forces:")
1.b.) Enemy Forces overview. The enemy forces have temporarily seized Charkia and forced C/101 “Ruda” into retreat. However, the enemy sustained 60% combat causalities securing this objective and cannot adequately mass a sufficient large enough combat force to repeal sustained counter-attacks.
<br/>
<br/>
1.b.1.) Composition, Disposition and Strength. We expect to encounter a severely reduced mechanized infantry company consisting of 1 full platoon strength element (M2A2, dismounts, Javelin, M240), 2-3 fireteam sized elements equipped with limited ATGM capabilities, and a 60mm mortar section.
<br/>
<br/>
1.b.2.) Most Probable Course of Action. Enemy will attempt to destroy our BMP-3s at the max effective range of their M2A2s. Once our BMP-3s are destroyed, our infantry will have limited mobility and will likely be destroyed as they cross the terrain south of Telos and towards Charkia.
<br/>
<br/>
1b.3.) Most Dangerous Course of Action. No change to above scenario except, enemy will combine both direct and indirect fires onto our BMPs in order to disable destroy our vehicles.
<br/>
<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:<br/>
OBSERVATION.  Enemy elements in the OPs will have limited optics aside from what is provided by their ATGM systems and personal binoculars.<br/>
INDIRECT.  1 The enemy has 1 x 60mm mortar section (2k range) providing indirect fire support to the their forward elements.<br/>
DIRECT.  The PLT will have M2A2 that will have thermals and will be able to engage friendly forces out to (2km). Individual arms will consist of M4, M249, M240, AT-4, and a limited number of Javelin systems.<br/>
OBSTACLES. The enemy M109s have deployed a FASCAM minefield south of Kalithea consisting of anti-armor mines. We should not cross to the east of MSR Krasniy past the 176 Easting. <br/>
CHEMICAL.  None.<br/>
AIR.  None.

NEWTAB("B. Friendly Forces:")
1.c. Friendly:<br/>
<br/>
1.c.1.) 101 Mech Infantry Battalion (MIBN) Mission. Our battalion is reconsolidating after the enemy’s initial attack. A/101 MIBN is at the highest readiness condition and tasked as being the first assault element.
<br/>
<br/>
1.c.2.) Concept of A/101 MIBN Defense Mission.  The decisive point of this mission is the successful seize of OBJ Seeniy. This will require infantry securing key points of terrain inside the objective for more than 20 minutes (see Annex 4 for details).
<br/>
<br/>
1.c.3. Adjacent Units: All friendly units have displaced to the North of MSR Krasniy.
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("III. Execution:")
<br/>Notes on Execution:
- There will be a 5 minute setup timer for both sides. Neither side will be able to move more than 100m outside their initial setup zone (see Annex 4).<br/>
- Depending on the outcome of the previous event, Kurgan 1 will have command of either an 8 x personnel GAZ Tiger scout section (Akatsiya 4) or a T-90 section with reduced ammo (Akatsiya 4).<br/>
- You will observe Geneva conventions and refrain from engaging the MEDEVAC M113. However, M113 must not be used for transportation of non-wounded or it loses Geneva protections.
